[[pre-commit-intro]]
== Introduction

Developing code for the FreeBSD operating system has evolved over the years.
The Project has found a number of best pracitces for developing software over the years.
Developers and contributors that have followed these practices have generally produced better code than those that did not.
Software development is imperfect at best, and by following these guidelines as appropraite, higher quality code can result.

This article gives advice in the following areas
. Planning the changes
. Implementation outside the tree
. Pre-commit testing
. Pre-commit code review
. Commiting the code
. Post-commit considerations

While applicable to all development, this guide is focused on those items that take substantial effort to implement.
For bug fixes, these guides can also be useful, though not all advice would be relevant.
